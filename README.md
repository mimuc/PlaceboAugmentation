# The Placebo Effect of Human Augmentation - Study Implementation Files

Dear reader, in this repository you will find the necessary files to replicate and run the Revised Columbia Card Task (RCCT) presented in our manuscript. The javascript code already integrates a LabstreamingLayer connection to save the triggers in the EEG Streams when flipping the cards. The base experiment is adapted from "The Experiment Factory":
## Experiment Factory Experiment

This is an Experiment that is friendly for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.
